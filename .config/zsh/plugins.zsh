# ~/.config/zsh/plugins.zsh — Optional Zsh Enhancements

# =====================
# Optional Plugins (Commented Out)
# =====================
# These are available if you want a nicer zsh experience
# Fish has these built-in, so only needed for zsh fallback

# Autosuggestions (fish-like)
# if [ -f /opt/homebrew/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh ]; then
#   source /opt/homebrew/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
# fi

# Syntax highlighting
# if [ -f /opt/homebrew/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh ]; then
#   source /opt/homebrew/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
# fi
